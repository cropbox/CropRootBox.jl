# CropRootBox.jl

[CropRootBox.jl](https://github.com/cropbox/CropRootBox.jl) implements a root system architecture simulation algorithm described in [CRootBox](https://plant-root-soil-interactions-modelling.github.io/CRootBox/) model. Our implementation is written in a domain-specific language based on Julia using [Cropbox](https://github.com/cropbox/Cropbox.jl) framework. While Cropbox framework was primarily designed for helping development of conventional process-based crop models with less dynamic structural development in mind, it is still capable of handling complex structure as envisioned by functional-structural plant models (FSPM).

## Installation

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("CropRootBox")
```

## Getting Started

```@example root
using Cropbox
using CropRootBox
```

`BaseRoot` is a common system inherited by other systems representing each root type, *i.e.*, `PrimaryRoot`, `FirstOrderLateralRoot`, and `SecondOrderLateralRoot` in this example.

```@example root
parameters(CropRootBox.BaseRoot; alias = true)
```

Here is an example configuration for simulating maize root growth. Some parameter values are annotated with standard deviation after `±` indicating actual values are randomly sampled from normal distribution as needed.

```@example root
config = @config(
    :RootArchitecture => :maxB => 5,
    :BaseRoot => :T => [
        # P F S
          0 1 0 ; # P
          0 0 1 ; # F
          0 0 0 ; # S
    ],
    :PrimaryRoot => (;
        lb = 0.1 ± 0.01,
        la = 18.0 ± 1.8,
        ln = 0.6 ± 0.06,
        lmax = 89.7 ± 7.4,
        r = 6.0 ± 0.6,
        Δx = 0.5,
        σ = 10,
        θ = 80 ± 8,
        N = 1.5,
        a = 0.04 ± 0.004,
        color = CropRootBox.RGBA(1, 0, 0, 1),
    ),
    :FirstOrderLateralRoot => (;
        lb = 0.2 ± 0.04,
        la = 0.4 ± 0.04,
        ln = 0.4 ± 0.03,
        lmax = 0.6 ± 1.6,
        r = 2.0 ± 0.2,
        Δx = 0.1,
        σ = 20,
        θ = 70 ± 15,
        N = 1,
        a = 0.03 ± 0.003,
        color = CropRootBox.RGBA(0, 1, 0, 1),
    ),
    :SecondOrderLateralRoot => (;
        lb = 0,
        la = 0.4 ± 0.02,
        ln = 0,
        lmax = 0.4,
        r = 2.0 ± 0.2,
        Δx = 0.1,
        σ = 20,
        θ = 70 ± 10,
        N = 2,
        a = 0.02 ± 0.002,
        color = CropRootBox.RGBA(0, 0, 1, 1),
    )
)
; # hide
```

An instance of `RootArchitecture` system is created with an instance of `Pot` describing a boundary of root growth.

```@example root
b = instance(CropRootBox.Pot)
s = instance(CropRootBox.RootArchitecture; config, options = (; box = b), seed = 0)
r = simulate!(s, stop = 100u"d")
; # hide
```

After 100 days of simulation, we can draw a rendering of root structure bounded in the pot.

```@example root
using GLMakie
scn = CropRootBox.render(s)
GLMakie.save("root_maize.png", scn; resolution = (1600, 3200))
; # hide
```
