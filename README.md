[CropRootBox.jl](https://github.com/cropbox/CropRootBox.jl) implements a root system architecture simulation algorithm described in [CRootBox](https://plant-root-soil-interactions-modelling.github.io/CRootBox/) model. Our implementation is written in a domain-specific language based on Julia using [Cropbox](https://github.com/cropbox/Cropbox.jl) framework. While Cropbox framework was primarily designed for helping development of conventional process-based crop models with less dynamic structural development in mind, it is still capable of handling complex structure as envisioned by functional-structural plant models (FSPM).
